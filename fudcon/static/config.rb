# Require any additional compass plugins here.

# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/" #root level target path
css_dir = "css" #targets our default style.css file at the root level of our theme
sass_dir = "sass" #targets our sass directory
images_dir = "images" #targets our pre existing image directory
javascripts_dir = "js" #targets our JavaScript directory

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):
# output_style = :expanded or :nested or :compact or :compressed

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
